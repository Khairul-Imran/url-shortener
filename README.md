## Description
This URL Shortener Application is a web-based tool designed to simplify the sharing of long URLs by generating shorter, easy-to-share links. This project was created to showcase proficiency in backend and frontend development, as well as database management.

## Features
1. Shorten long URLs into concise and shareable links ending with either an "Alias" chosen by the user or a randomly generated hash using Base 62 encoding.
2. Validation checks to prevent duplicate aliases or invalid links from being used.
3. Copy button for quick copying of the shortened URL to the clipboard.
4. Generate QR codes linked to the shortened URL for easy sharing.
5. Download QR code images for offline use.
6. Expiry feature to automatically purge database entries after 15 minutes to optimise storage space.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Java with Spring Framework
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Usage
1. Start the backend server and database service.
2. Run the frontend of the application in a web browser.
3. Enter the long URL you want to shorten and click the "Shorten" button.
4. Copy the generated short URL to share with others.
5. Optionally, use the QR code feature to generate and download QR codes.
